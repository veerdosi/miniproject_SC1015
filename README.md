## Title: Early Prediction of Heart Failure Using Clinical Features

### Problem Statement

**Introduction**: Heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, posing significant public health challenges. Early detection of heart failure, a major form of heart disease, is critical for improving patient outcomes and managing healthcare resources efficiently.

**Problem Statement**: Despite advancements in medical science, many individuals at risk of heart failure remain undiagnosed until the disease progresses to advanced stages. Traditional diagnostic methods can be invasive, expensive, and not universally accessible, creating a need for alternative early detection techniques.

### Objectives

To develop a predictive model that utilizes easily obtainable clinical features to identify individuals at high risk of heart failure, facilitating early intervention and potentially saving lives.

### Dataset Description

The dataset, titled “Heart Failure Prediction Dataset,” comprises medical records from patients, featuring variables such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, culminating in a binary indicator of heart disease presence. This comprehensive dataset serves as the foundation for our predictive modeling.

### Methodology

**Data Preparation and Cleaning**: Initial steps involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing continuous variables to prepare the data for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We examined the distribution and relationships among clinical variables to uncover patterns and correlations that could indicate heart failure risk.

**Feature Engineering**: New features were derived to enhance the model's predictive capability, including interaction terms between clinically significant variables.

**Model Development**: We applied several machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, optimizing them to achieve the best performance in predicting heart failure.

**Evaluation and Optimization**: Models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC, with hyperparameter tuning performed to refine their predictive performance.
